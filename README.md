# Great Good Test Assignment

## Description

This project is a full-stack application for simple staking contract on Mumbai testnet.

## Prerequisites

-   Node 18

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate frontend and backend folders:

-   **client**: Contains the frontend codebase built with React.js.
-   **server**: Contains the backend codebase built with Node.js and Express.js.

Each folder contains its own detailed README.md file with explanation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder for frontend setup:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the frontend application.

6. Navigate to the `server` folder for backend setup:
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    ```
7. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
8. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
9. The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React.js and contains the user interface of the application. It interacts with the backend API to fetch and display data.

## Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js. It provides APIs to handle requests from the frontend.
