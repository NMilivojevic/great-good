# Backend Documentation

## Overview

This project serves as the backend for the React part of the application. The backend is responsible for handling API requests related to blockchain interactions.

## Project setup

-   **Development Environment**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js framework.
-   **Blockchain Integration**: Utilized Web3.js for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
-   **Folder Structure**: Organized the backend into the following structure:
    -   `/contracts`: Contains Solidity smart contract files and their compiled JSON artifacts.
    -   `/controllers`: Handles the logic for each route.
    -   `/routes`: Defines routes and their corresponding handlers.
    -   `/services`: Provides functionality for interacting with the blockchain or other backend operations.
    -   `/utils`: Houses utility functions and configurations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

-   `services`: Contains modules responsible for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contract.
-   `controllers`: Handles HTTP request/response logic.
-   `routes`: Defines API endpoints and routes requests to the appropriate controllers.

## Polygon Mumbai Test Network Connection

The backend service connects to the Polygon Mumbai Test Network using the Infura endpoint.

## Flow for Balance Retrieval

1. **Service Layer**:

    - The `balanceService.js` module (`/services/balanceService.js`) defines the `getBalance` function.
    - This function interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using the `contractService` to retrieve the balance of a specified account.

2. **Controller Layer**:

    - The `balanceController.js` module (`/controllers/balanceController.js`) imports the `getBalance` function from `balanceService.js`.
    - It defines an async function `getBalance` that handles HTTP requests to fetch balance information.
    - Upon receiving a request, it calls the `getBalance` function from `balanceService` and sends the balance as a JSON response.

3. **Routing Layer**:
    - The `balanceRoutes.js` module (`/routes/balanceRoutes.js`) defines a route to handle GET requests for retrieving balance.
    - It imports the `getBalance` function from the `balanceController` and sets up a route to trigger this function when a GET request is made to `/:account`.

## Flow for Minimum Stake Amount and Total Supply

The flow for retrieving minimum stake amount and total supply follows a similar pattern as the balance retrieval flow, with separate service, controller, and route modules for each functionality. These modules are named accordingly (`minStakeService.js`, `minStakeController.js`, `minStakeRoutes.js`, `totalSupplyService.js`, `totalSupplyController.js`, `totalSupplyRoutes.js`) and follow the same structure and organization as described above for balance retrieval.

## Error handling

Error handling might be omitted or kept minimal to streamline development efforts and focus on demonstrating key features. The primary emphasis is on demonstrating functionality and meeting project requirements. Error handling may be added in subsequent iterations or as part of future development efforts.

## Dependencies

-   **express**: Web framework for Node.js, used to handle HTTP requests.
-   **cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from different origins.
-   **dotenv**: Library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
-   **web3**: Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with Ethereum nodes.

## Environment Variables

To run the server application locally, you'll need to set up the following environment variables:

-   **INFURA_URL**: The URL of the Infura endpoint.
-   **INFURA_KEY**: The Infura project ID.
-   **CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: The address of the smart contract.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the `server` folder.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

```
INFURA_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/
INFURA_KEY=7dca142182e54feabf04bacfd87732d7
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xdD08C4f14475D419ebe6C9f31865bf3730f7EF92

```
